      "shortDescription": "",
      "description": "Experience the beauty of Mt. Rainier National Park in the comfort of your own private tour. The adventure begins from your hotel, where your personal local expert will pick your party up in a Pearl Chevrolet Suburban LTZ. \n\nWork with your tour guide to create the best itinerary and stops for your group. See and experience places within the National Park that our public tour cannot reach. Set the tone for the day by leaning more towards an adventure, hiking-filled day or sit back and relax while you enjoy a leisurely, scenic day on the mountain. It’s up to you!\n\nFor tours November - April, we can only access the roads in the park which do not require chains. These tours often cannot make it to Paradise, Christine or Narada Falls. We offer snow shoes as a replacement as the majority of the tour will take place at Longmire. ",
