      "shortDescription": "A 4-hour picturesque tour of downtown Seattle highlights and the stunning 268-foot Snoqualmie Falls waterfall.",
      "description": "Our Seattle tour begins at the Pike Place Market. After everyone is aboard the shuttle, we will set off on our experience of Seattle. As we navigate the city's streets, your professional guide will provide an engaging and informative narration of major events in Seattle's history. You'll hear fascinating stories about the Great Seattle Fire of 1889, the history of \"Underground\" Seattle, and how the Klondike Gold Rush helped turn the city into the most important port in the Pacific Northwest. After leaving the city behind, we'll journey through the scenic town of Snoqualmie, nestled in the Cascade foothills. The 268-foot waterfall is one of the most breathtaking natural wonders in the Pacific Northwest. Our next stop is the iconic Fremont Troll, nestled beneath a bridge. Just around the corner, you'll encounter a 16-foot-tall statue of Vladimir Lenin. Next, we'll visit the Ballard Locks where you'll have about 30 minutes to explore the grounds, view the fish ladder, and snap some memorable photos. The final stop is Kerry Park, the #1 rated location for photos of the city skyline. Between 2-2:15 PM, your tour will end and we will drop you back off at Pike Place Market.",

Today you can visit the Boeing factory, with the tours being one of the most popular tours in Washington State. The Boeing Factory located in Everett, Washington is the home for the production of the historic 747, the 787 Dreamliner as well as the 767 and 777. The hour and a half factory tour presented by The Boeing Company will give you an opportunity to see a production facility that is so big that all of Disneyland can fit into the building with room to spare. The 45 minute drive with your guide will include historic background on the Boeing Company as well as additional information and history of Seattle. Upon arrival, your guide will help you with tour tickets and use of lockers for cameras and bags. You'll have time to enjoy the Future of Flight interactive displays before the factory tour begins. After the tour, you'll have additional time to browse the Boeing gift shop and visit the Strato Deck overlooking the Paine Field runway.
