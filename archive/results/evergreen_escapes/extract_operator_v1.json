      "description": "On this day trip from Seattle to Mt. Rainier, savor Mt. Rainier's hidden beauty on foot with waterfall walks, giant trees, alpine vistas, wildflower meadows, and wildlife watching. Stroll through the old-growth forests near Longmire, where Douglas fir, hemlock, and cedar trees dwarf visitors. The bubbling natural springs tell a story of what lies beneath this abundant and volatile landscape. Experience waterfalls and big mountain views as you wind to higher elevations. On summer Mt. Rainier tours (June-Oct), pick wild berries on a sub-alpine hiking trail. On winter tours (Nov-May), take advantage of Paradise's legendary snowfall (and the winter solitude) on an introductory snowshoe trail.\n\nThis isn't just another driving tour of a National Park — experience the highlights beyond the vehicle during walks and hikes tailored to your ability. Our guides run the only day tours permitted to explore more than a mile from the park road. Join a few other travelers (each tour is ten people or fewer) and a TripAdvisor 'Hall of Fame' guide on a real exploration of our beautiful home.\n\nSleep in a little – we're bringing breakfast pastries, local coffee, and tea. Don't waste daylight waiting in line at a busy lunch counter in the National Park – we'll bring a fresh, local, family-style lunch to enjoy with an exceptional view. Replenish with snacks, sparkling water, and water throughout the tour. Don't worry about a thing!",

Rainier to experience all that the famous volcano has to offer—from cascading waterfalls to mammoth old growth forests, panoramic views to ancient glacial ice. We take in incredible vistas and keep our feet moving, exploring the various facets of this geographic landmark and the remarkable terrain which surrounds it.\n\nOn this tour, we circumnavigate \"The Mountain\" (as Mt. Rainier is known to locals), witnessing the highest concentration of glaciers in the continental U.S., and taking time to get to know the residents as we go. Deer, elk, black bear, marmots, and mountain goats abound in the forests and alpine meadows of this high-country wonderland.\n\nDay 1: Journey to Sunrise – hike above the tree-line through open heather and rocky alpine tundra, visit Emmons Glacier and Second Burroughs Mountain. Overnight at historic Paradise Inn with dinner.\n\nDay 2: Hike from Paradise Inn up the flanks of Mt. Rainier toward Camp Muir through wildflowers and berry patches, then descend into lush old growth rainforests on the western slopes with waterfalls and glacial rivers.",

If you are interested in snowshoeing, sign up for a Friday departure of a small group tour or reach out about a private tour for Saturday or Sunday. If you would prefer to stay out of the snow, we recommend signing up for the Monday departure."

The ecosystems you will experience at either Lake Crescent or Lake Quinault are very similar to the Hoh region.

After exploring Snoqualmie Falls, you'll explore Washington's viticulture with tastings at two or three local wineries (depending on the season) that deliver on elegance but leave pretense at the door. You'll meet with the passionate winemakers themselves and learn about their journey into the industry. While Washington is the second largest wine-producer in the country, it only exports 1% of its wine!",
