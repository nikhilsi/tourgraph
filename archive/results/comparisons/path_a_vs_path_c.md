## 3. Strategic Analysis

### Coverage Gap
- **3/7** operators found on Viator
- **4/7** operators are Path A exclusive (not on Viator)
- Path A extracted **83** products vs Path C's **10**

### Path A Advantages (extraction captures what Viator doesn't)
- Promo codes and active discounts (e.g., RAINIER10)
- Cross-operator bundles (e.g., Tours NW + Argosy combo)
- Booking system identification (FareHarbor, Peek Pro, Bookeo, etc.)
- Operator-authored FAQs with local knowledge
- Operators not on any OTA (the long tail)

### Path C Advantages (Viator has what extraction can't get)
- Reviews and ratings (structured, multi-source)
- Standardized pricing with age bands
- Real-time availability (with Full Access)
- CDN-hosted professional images in multiple sizes
- Structured accessibility and additional info
- Product options / variants
- Language guide information
